# Web Design - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)
## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this Project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations. I created in a past assignment. Specifically, I plotted [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
